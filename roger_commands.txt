						**Random Notes**
- (allow-hotplug) is basically and updated version of (auto) in network interface file
- (for setting up static NAT ip part) enp0s8 is innet always, enp0s9 is the host-only
- (for setting /30) subnet mask is /30 or 255.255.255.252 which means only two bits(32 -30) are available for host address and valid host will be2^2 - 2 = 2. /30 subnet is used for point to point link for e.g.when a router is connected to another router.
- (netmask in 30) used to divide an IP address into two parts. One part identifies the host (computer), the other part identifies the network to which it belongs. /30 is class less so you can lease the network to ppl or web servers.
- (for checking ssh unable to connect issues) ssh -vvv account@your-ip / ssh -vvv brandon@roger1 
- (check status of ssh server) sudo systemctl status ssh
- (if ssh server down) sudo systemctl start ssh
- (reload ssh server) sudo systemctl reload sshd.service
- (copy public key to user) ssh-copy-id brandon@10.113.100.38 -p 58342
- (check what ip or port your ssh server is using) netstat -tapen
- (check routing table) sudo route
- (check firewall INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT) iptables -L -n
