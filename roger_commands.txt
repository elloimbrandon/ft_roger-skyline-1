						**Random Used Commands & Their Usage**

- service networking restart (apply network interface changes daemon)

						**Random Notes For Clarity**
- (allow-hotplug) is basically and updated version of (auto) in network interface file
- (for setting up static NAT ip part) enp0s8 is innet always, enp0s9 is the host-only
- (for setting /30) subnet mask is /30 or 255.255.255.252 which means only two bits(32 -30) are available for host address and valid host will be2^2 - 2 = 2. /30 subnet is used for point to point link for e.g.when a router is connected to another router.
- (netmask in 30) used to divide an IP address into two parts. One part identifies the host (computer), the other part identifies the network to which it belongs. /30 is class less so you can lease the network to ppl or web servers.
- (for checking ssh unable to connect issues) ssh -vvv account@your-ip / ssh -vvv brandon@roger1 
- (check status of ssh server) sudo systemctl status ssh
- (if ssh server down) sudo systemctl start ssh
- (reload ssh server) sudo systemctl reload sshd.service
- (remove all sshd shit) sudo apt-get purge openssh-server
- (login as root) ssh root@10.113.100.38 -p 58342 / ssh brandon@10.113.100.38 -p 58342 *make sure passwd auth is yes*
- (copy public key to user) ssh-copy-id brandon@10.113.100.38 -p 58342
- (check what ip or port your ssh server is using) netstat -tapen
- (check routing table) sudo route
- (check firewall INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT) iptables -L -n
*****MOVED FROM STEPS/ DONT NEED?*****
   - (store public key(id_rsa.pub) in .ssh directory) sudo cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
 *connecting via ssh with public keys require certain permissions for directorys and files below*
   - (home directory should not be writeable) sudo chmod go-w /home/brandon
   - (ssh directory needs 700 permissions) sudo chmod 700 /home/brandon/.ssh
   - (authorized_keys needs 644 permissions) sudo chmod 644 /home/brandon/.ssh/authorized_keys
   - (if users home directory doesnt contain the right .ssh directory) sudo usermod -d /home/brandon brandon

ssh-keygen

cat ~ / .ssh / id_rsa.pub and copy the entire contents.

ssh root@roger1 -p 58342 / ssh brandon@roger1 -p 58342

mkdir .ssh

Then paste the key into .ssh/authorized_keys

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

//change line to:
PasswordAuthentification no.
sudo service ssh restart

#Exit the ssh with exit and retry a connection with the previous command.

#The connection is now password-free with PublicKeys.

#You will find your VM in the .ssh / known_hosts file.

*********Random
	(exact keyfile) ssh -i /nfs/2018/b/brfeltz/.ssh/authorized_keys brandon@10.113.100.38 -p 58342
	(current ip and port connected ssh) brandon from 10.113.5.16 port 49581 ssh2

*****SSH KEY INFO
-The private key is kept within a restricted directory. The SSH client will not recognize private keys that are not kept in restricted directories. The key itself must also have restricted permissions (read and write only available for the owner). This means that other users on the system cannot snoop.
- (permissions for .ssh directory) chmod 700/755 .ssh
- (permissions for public key file) chmod 644 authorized_keys
- (home directory?) chmod 755/700 brandon

- (used for digitalocean server) ssh root@167.172.112.240
