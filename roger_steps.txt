							**Roger-Skyline-1 Steps**
1. follow steps to set up debain 9 stretch virtual image ide (https://www.tecmint.com/installation-of-debian-9-minimal-server/)
2. use debian download in folder for disk image (Desktop/debian versions/debian-9.9.0-amd64-netinst.iso)
3  set network settings in virtualbox for your machine to Adapter1 to : bridged adapter
   set Adapter 2 to : NAT
   (if your in a dif cluster you might need to change to *host only adapter*/ instead of bridged adapter)
4. machine roger1 login: brandon
5. user password: sports (same for root)
6. add current user(brandon) to sudo group to use commands outside of root
7. go to /etc/network/interfaces and add these lines for network interface changes
	** #NAT Network
	   allow-hotplug enp0s8
	   iface enp0s8 inet static
	   address 192.168.56.3
	   netmask 255.255.255.252
	**
	(possibly reboot) / *Make sure network adapter2 is active*
	restart network interface daemon via (sudo service networking restart)
	bring interface down (sudo ifdown enp0s3, sudo ifdown enp0s8)
	bring interface up (sudo ifup enp0s3, sudo ifup enp0s8)
8. go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config and unhash as well as changes these lines
	** Port 58342
	   PermitRootLogin no
	   PasswordAuthentification yes
	   PubkeyAuthentication yes
	**
	restart SSH (sudo service sshd restart)
9. (as user not root generate keys) ssh-keygen *should create .ssh directory /home/brandon/.ssh*
   (store public key(id_rsa.pub) in .ssh directory) sudo cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
   *connecting via ssh with public keys require certain permissions for directorys and files below*
   - (home directory should not be writeable) sudo chmod go-w /home/brandon
   - (ssh directory needs 700 permissions) sudo chmod 700 /home/brandon/.ssh
   - (authorized_keys needs 644 permissions) sudo chmod 644 /home/brandon/.ssh/authorized_keys
   - (if users home directory doesnt contain the right .ssh directory) sudo usermod -d /home/brandon brandon
   go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config change line
   **
   	PasswordAuthentification no
   **
   (restart ssh server to update sshd) service ssh restart
   (we're going to connect to the static ip) *192.168.56.3*
   (now connect to ssh server without password) ssh -p 58342 brandon@192.168.56.3 
   (check to see if you connected successfully) sudo systemctl status ssh
   *go to /home/brandon/.ssh and check to see if know_hosts file contains your vm*
   -the user(brandon) will have sudo access vi ssh and not root

								**Command Steps**
1. ->su root (access as root user)
2. ->apt update && apt upgrade
3. ->apt install sudo && apt install vim && apt install net-tools && apt install ssh && apt install open-ssh && apt install fail2ban && apt update (use of sudo, vim, ifconfig, ssh)
4. ->adduser brandon sudo
5. ->exit (leaving root to user)
6. ->reboot (so user can be added to sudoers file)
8. ->see (roger-skyline-1 step 7)
9. ->sudo ip a (to see if network interface was applied)
10.->see (roger-skyline-1 step 8)
11.->see (roger-skyline-1 step 9)
